Here are some Spring Microservices interview questions for a developer with 3 years of experience:

Basic Questions
What are microservices? How do they differ from monolithic architecture?
What are the key benefits of using microservices architecture?
What are some challenges in implementing microservices?
What is the role of Spring Boot in microservices?
How do you create a microservice in Spring Boot?

Spring Cloud Basics
What is Spring Cloud, and why is it used in microservices?
What is Service Discovery? Explain with an example.
What is Netflix Eureka? How does it work with Spring Boot?
What is Feign Client? How is it used for inter-service communication?
Explain the purpose of Spring Cloud Config Server.
What is a Circuit Breaker? How does Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker help in fault tolerance?
Advanced Concepts
What is API Gateway? How is it implemented using Spring Cloud Gateway?
What is Hystrix, and why is it used?
What is distributed tracing, and how do you implement it in Spring Microservices?
  log contains JSON or plain text to record the events happened during an API request.
  It does not show end to end journey of an API request across microservices.
  It is harder to identify whether the logs in two different microservices belong to same request or not.

  Tracing tracks the path of the request across the microservices. It shows high level information like : 
  -  which service called which service.
  -  how much time each service took 
  -  status code of each service.
  It does not store detailed logs.

  Trace Id - it connects request across microservices with 1 unique ID.
  Span IDs - Each service has its unique span id.
What is load balancing? How is it achieved in Spring Microservices?
How do you handle session consistency in microservices?
Data and Communication
How do microservices share data?
What are synchronous and asynchronous communication methods in microservices?
What is the difference between REST and gRPC for communication?
How do you ensure data consistency in microservices (e.g., Saga Pattern)?
Explain event-driven architecture. How would you implement it in a Spring-based microservices system?
Deployment and Security
What is Docker, and how do you containerize a Spring Boot microservice?
What is Kubernetes, and how does it help in deploying microservices?
How do you secure microservices using Spring Security and OAuth2?
What is JWT, and how is it used in securing microservices?

Testing and Monitoring
How do you test a microservice in isolation?
What tools do you use for testing microservices (e.g., Postman, MockMVC)?
What is centralized logging? How do you implement it in Spring Microservices?
What is Prometheus and Grafana? How do they help in monitoring microservices?
How would you handle performance issues in a Spring Microservices architecture?
Scenario-Based Questions
How would you design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce application?
What happens if a service registry like Eureka goes down? How do you handle it?
What would you do if a downstream service becomes unresponsive?
How would you manage versioning in a microservices-based application?
How do you scale individual microservices?
