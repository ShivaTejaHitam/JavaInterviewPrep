Maven is project management tool. Helps developers with 
1) Build generation
2) Dependency resolution
3) Documentation generation etc

maven uses pom to achieve this.
when maven command is given, it looks for pom.xml in the current directory and get necessary config.

<project> tag specifies the schema , also makes sure that our XML adheres to the correct structure and version defined by maven
<parent> used to define parent pom . by default( if no parent is specified) we inherit the configuration from super pom  

<groupId>, <artifactId> , <version>, <name> - Unique identifier of your project

<properties> - Define key value pairs for configuration.It can be referenced through out the pom file
<repositories> <repository> </repository> </repositories> - this is where maven looks for dependencies and downloads artifacts(jars) .It is added by default even if we don't add it
<dependencies> <dependency> </dependency> </dependencies> - this is where we declare the dependencies required for our project
<build> - to add goals to phase through <plugin>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Build Lifecycle

if you run specific goal of a particular phase, the all goals of previous phases + current phase goals before the one you defined will run.
phases :validate - compile - test- package - verify - install - deploy
each phase has a goals
