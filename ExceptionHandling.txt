Exception: 
- it is an event that occurs during the execution of the program
- it disrupts the normal flow of the program
- it creates the Exception object which contains information about the error like 
   - type of exception and msg
   - stack trace etc
- Runtime system use this exception and checks which class can handle this. If no class or method is handling it the program terminates and stack trace is printed


Checked Exception - code will not compile if checked exception is not handled.

Try block should be followed by either catch block or finally .
If a checked exception is not thrown by a method, we should not write a catch block to handle it. If we write it leads to compilation issue

finally block executes at any case , even if you return from the try block.
finally does not execute in cases like Error (OutofMemory , etc)
