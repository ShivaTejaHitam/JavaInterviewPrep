when we try to modify the collection(add or remove) while traversing it throws concurrentModificationException. 

collections like ArrayList, Map etc., uses fail fast iterator . 


Collections like ConcurrentHashMap , CopyOnWriteArrayList uses fail safe iterator. They can be used to modify along with iteration.
they perform iteration on a snapshot of the collection. So if the collection size is 3 it prints only 3 elements even if you add elements during iteration.

another way to do concurrent modification is iterator.remove method.

another way is to perform removal operations on copy of collection.
